 <h3>About my studies</h3>
 <p>I was born and raisd in Hungary. I gradueted in 2012.<br/> In the High School i stadied "IT" in high number of hours, so it's not really new to me, i learned some basic frome html.
I stadied, worked and lived here untill 2015.
In 2015 i started to live in the UK. I got a job over there and i was working as a waitress. I spended 5 years in the Uk and i loved to be there.
